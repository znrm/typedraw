# TypeDraw

*A cross-platform app for real-time collaboration.*

## Background and Overview (Zaniar)

## Functionality & MVP (Matt)

- [ ] Documents will have a text editor and a drawing pad layered on top of each other so that users can type and draw at the same time 
- [ ] Documents support multi-user document sharing by allowing invitations to other users through either Facebook or Gmail
- [ ] Real-time communication between devices (Mobile and Browser)
- [ ] Session persistence across devices allowing for changes to be seen as they are made
- [ ] Web and mobile application (iOs)

### Bonus Features

- [ ] Getting on the App Store
- [ ] Uploading a text document and allowing our app to draw over it 
- [ ] End-to-end encryption
- [ ] Document Parsing to parse over different type of document text files, and generating our own extension with drawing ontop of the document
- [ ] Group chat and voice chat for users to communicate as they are drawing and/or typing up a document

## Technologies & Challenges

### Architecture (Zaniar)

#### Backend: Node, Express, MongoDB

#### Frontend: React and React Native with Redux

### Realtime Communication (Matt)

We will be incorporating websockets with our app to implement real-time communication between our users. 

Our server will be listening for incoming connections and will establish a connection between clients through the WebSocket handshake when a request is made by a client.

We will be managing real-time display of changes by processing information from the upstream and downstream communications between our server and the clients.
